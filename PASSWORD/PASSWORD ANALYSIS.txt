PASSWORD STRINGTH ANALYSIS:

    *For this task, I created different types of passwords — some short and simple, some long
and complex — to see how secure they really are. I tested each one using free online password
strength checkers like PasswordMeter and HowSecureIsMyPassword. For each password, I
noted the score, how long it might take to crack, and the feedback given by the tool.


    *After comparing the results, I learned what actually makes a password strong: using a mix of uppercase
and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and making it long enough (at least 12–16 characters).
I also looked into common password attacks like brute force and dictionary attacks, which showed why
weak passwords are risky.

    *In the end, I put together a few tips for creating better passwords and why using things like
password managers and two-factor authentication can make accounts a lot safer
