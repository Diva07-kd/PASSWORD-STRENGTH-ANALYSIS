DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF OBTANED OUTPUT:

    I tested two very different passwords using passwordmeter.com to see how much password
complexity actually matters.


---

1. Anand@task242

    Score: 100%

    Complexity: Very Strong

    Length: 13 characters

CONTAINS:

    Uppercase letters → A

    Lowercase letters → nand and task

    Numbers → 242

    Symbol → @


Why it’s strong:

    This password ticks all the boxes for security — it’s long enough, mixes different character
    types, and isn’t a common phrase or dictionary word. Tools rated it “Very Strong” because it would
    take a brute force program a very long time to crack it. Even if someone tried a dictionary attack,
    it wouldn’t work since the password isn’t just normal words.

2. password

    Score: 8%

    Complexity: Very Weak

    Length: 8 characters

CONTAINS:

    Only lowercase letters

    No numbers, no symbols, no uppercase letters


Why it’s weak:
This is one of the most common passwords in the world. It’s in every hacker’s dictionary list,
so it would be cracked instantly without even trying all combinations. It’s also too short and
predictable, so brute force attacks would break it in no time.

OUTCOME:

From this test, it’s clear that length + variety of characters + unpredictability make the biggest
difference in password strength. A short, common word is like leaving your house door wide open,
while a long, mixed password is like having multiple secure locks.



Key Concepts & Risks (Detailed)



1. PASSWORD STRENGTH:

    Meaning: How secure your password is against different types of attacks.

    Factors: Length, variety of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols),
    and randomness.

Why it matters: A strong password makes it harder for hackers to guess or crack it. A weak
password is like giving them the keys to your account.

    Risk: Weak passwords can be cracked instantly, leading to account hacking, identity theft,
    or data leaks.



2. BRUTE FORCE ATTACK:

    Meaning: A hacking method where every possible character combination is tried until the
    right one is found.

    Example: If a password is “abc”, the attacker tries “aaa”, “aab”, “aac”… until “abc” is found.

    Risk: Short passwords (e.g., 6–8 characters) can be cracked in seconds or minutes. A 12+ character
    password can take years or even centuries to crack, depending on complexity.



3. DICTIONARY ATTACK:

    Meaning: Instead of trying random combinations, the attacker uses a pre-made list of common
    passwords and words from dictionaries.

    Example: The word “password” will be in every hacker’s dictionary file.

    Risk: If your password is a common word, name, or phrase, it can be cracked instantly without
    needing a brute force attack.


4. Authentication

    Meaning: The process of confirming your identity when you log in. This can include passwords,
    PIN codes, biometrics (fingerprint, face), or one-time codes sent to your phone/email.

    Risk: If authentication is weak (only a password and that password is easy to guess),
    your account can be taken over easily.
